## Important Considerations
Ensure Application Focus: The script sends keystrokes to the currently focused window. Make sure the application (e.g., a chat window) where you want to send the message is in focus.
Use with Caution: Automated keystrokes can cause unintended behavior if the wrong window is in focus. Test in a safe environment first.
Stopping the Script: You can stop the script by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal or command prompt where it's running.
