## Draw Character
This code is a Turtle Graphics script that uses the Python turtle module to draw a character, likely a cartoon character. The script defines several functions to draw different parts of the character, such as the legs, hands, face, eyes, and other details. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. Imports and Initial Setup
from turtle import *: Imports all functions and classes from the turtle module.
s = Screen(): Creates a screen object to set up the drawing window.
s.screensize(700, 1000): Sets the screen size to 700 by 1000 pixels.
speed(5): Sets the drawing speed of the turtle.

2. Utility Functions
my_goto(x, y): A helper function to move the turtle to a specific coordinate (x, y) without drawing a line.
pensize(2): Sets the width of the pen to 2 units.

## How to Run the Code

Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your computer.

Run the Script:
python draw_character.py       or, if you're using Python 3:          python3 draw_character.py

This will open a window where the turtle will draw the character as defined by the script.
